# My Zsh Setup

Simple repository with all my Zsh shortcuts and plugins.

## Usage

Installation should be easy, just clone the repository and source it from
your .zshrc

```
git clone https://github.com/rodnaph/myzsh.git
```

If Zsh is not already your default shell then you can make it so like this:

```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

When included, all dependencies should be loaded automatically for you.
